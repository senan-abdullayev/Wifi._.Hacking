In this section, we will walk through the process of capturing the 4-Way Handshake, which is essential for attacking WPA/WPA2-PSK networks. We'll start by verifying that the handshake capture is complete and usable. After that, we'll demonstrate how to recover the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) by cracking the handshake, giving you a clear understanding of how WPA/WPA2-PSK networks can be compromised. Finally, we'll connect to the network using the recovered key to show its practical use.



## 1. Reconnaissance

We begin by enabling monitor mode on our wlan0 interface using airmon-ng.

```
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```

Once our interface is in monitor mode, we can use airodump-ng to scan for available Wi-Fi networks and their associated clients. Additionally, we can use the option `-w WPA` to save the output of the scan into a file.

```
airodump-ng wlan0mon -c 1 -w WPA
```

## 2. Handshake Capture

The second step is to capture the 4-way handshake. This handshake occurs when a client connects to a WPA/WPA2-protected Wi-Fi network. By capturing this exchange, we obtain the necessary data to attempt password cracking offline.

By executing a deauthentication attack on connected clients using `aireplay-ng`, it forces them to reconnect to the access point. This allows us to capture the 4-way handshake using airodump-ng.

```
aireplay-ng -0 5 -a 80:2D:BF:FE:13:83 -c 8A:00:A9:9B:ED:1A wlan0mon
```

After initiating the deauthentication attack, the WPA handshake should appear in the `airodump-ng` output within a few seconds, indicating a successful capture.


## 3. Password Cracking

We can now proceed with cracking the captured handshake in order to retrieve the pre-shared key (PSK). Several tools are available for cracking WPA handshakes, including John the Ripper, Hashcat, Cowpatty, and Aircrack-ng, among others. Let's examine each of these tools individually.


#### Using Cowpatty

[CowPatty](https://github.com/joswr1ght/cowpatty) is a tool commonly used to verify and crack WPA handshakes. To validate whether a proper handshake has been captured, we can use CowPatty in check mode with the `-c` flag, followed by the capture file using `-r`.

```
cowpatty -c -r WPA-01.cap
```


If a valid handshake is present, CowPatty will indicate so in the output. This confirms that the file can be used for cracking attempts. To crack a WPA-PSK handshake using CowPatty, we need to specify the capture file, the dictionary (wordlist) file, and the SSID of the target Wi-Fi network. The `-f` option specifies the wordlist, `-r` provides the path to the packet capture file, and `-s` defines the SSID:

```
cowpatty -r WPA-01.cap -f /opt/wordlist.txt -s HackTheBox
```


#### Using Aircrack-ng

We can also use [aircrack-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=aircrack-ng) to crack the WPA-PSK from a captured handshake file. This tool tests each password in the provided wordlist against the handshake to try and recover the correct pre-shared key (PSK). We can use `-w` to specify the path to the wordlist.

```
aircrack-ng WPA-01.cap -w /opt/wordlist.txt  
```


#### Using John the Ripper

[John the Ripper](https://github.com/openwall/john) can also be used to recover WPA passphrases. However, since John requires a specific hash format, we must first extract and convert the necessary data from the `.cap` or `.pcap` file using [wpapcap2john](https://github.com/willstruggle/john/blob/master/wpapcap2john). This tool parses the captured 4-Way Handshake and generates a hash that John can use for offline password cracking.

```
/opt/wpapcap2john wpa-Induction.pcap
```

We can then use the extracted hash with John the Ripper and a wordlist to begin cracking:

```
john hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=wpapsk
```


#### Using Hashcat

To crack WPA/WPA2 passwords with [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/), we first need to extract the appropriate hash from a `.pcap` or `.pcapng` capture file into Hashcat's accepted format. [hcxpcapngtool](https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxtools) is the go-to utility to convert handshake captures into Hashcat-friendly format.

```
hcxpcapngtool -o hash wpa-Induction.pcap
```

Finally, to crack the hash, we use the `-m 22000` option in Hashcat, followed by the hash file and the wordlist we want to use for the brute-force attack.

```
hashcat -m 22000 --force hash /opt/wordlist.txt
```

## 4. Access Verification

Once a valid PSK has been obtained (or valid credentials, in the case of WPA2-Enterprise), we can proceed with access verification. To do this, we simply enter the PSK or credentials into the system's network manager when prompted.


## Common Pitfalls

Cracking WPA or WPA2 handshakes can be highly time-consuming and in many cases unsuccessful. Whether the network type is WPA2 (offline cracking), WPA3 (online cracking), or WPA2-Enterprise (offline cracking), we may face several challenges during the process:

1. The actual password may not exist in our `wordlist`.
2. Brute-force attacks can take an impractical amount of time if we lack information about the `password structure`.
3. WPA/WPA2 passwords can range from `8` to `63` characters, depending on the implementation, making exhaustive searches difficult.
4. Passwords may be too `complex` or `unique` to appear in commonly used wordlists.
5. Default or commonly used password patterns may be `overlooked` during our attempts.


Regardless of the wireless standard we are targeting, it's important to ask ourselves a few key questions to improve our chances of success:

1. `Is the target network using WPA-Enterprise?` If so, we may be able to gather information about specific users, which can help us craft more effective, personalized wordlists.
2. `Do we know anything about the administrator?` Personal connections or online presence might reveal hobbies or interests that could influence password choices.
3. `Does the SSID indicate a default configuration?` If yes, we can attempt default password wordlists or create a custom list based on the device model or manufacturer.
4. `Do we have the computational resources to perform brute-force attacks?` If resources permit, we could consider incremental brute-force or hybrid attacks as a last resort.
