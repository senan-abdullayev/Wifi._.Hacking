Not all access points (APs) are equal. During an assessment, we may find some are more vulnerable to fragmentation than others. As an alternative, we can employ the [Korek Chop Chop Attack](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=korek_chopchop) to similarly capture a packet and retrieve the 1500 bytes of PRGA. Known technically as an `Inverse Arbaugh` attack, chop chop uses inductive reasoning to decrypt the packet without needing the key.

This is achieved by abusing the Integrity Check Value (ICV) in WEP. If we recall, the ICV ensures the integrity of the transmitted message. In the case of WEP, the CRC32 algorithm is used to calculate this value; if the ICV of a packet is not valid, it will be dropped by the access point (AP) upon receipt. This seemingly benign interaction creates an opportunity for attackers.


### Performing the Attack

```
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```

```
airodump-ng wlan0mon -c 1 -w WEP
```

Next, we initiate the `KoreK chop chop` attack in a second terminal. The source MAC address used should be capable of associating with the network. If we need to conduct the attack without authentication and association, there are two options: either omit the `-h` flag (though this can result in dropped packets), or specify the MAC address of an already connected station, which tends to be more reliable. The `-4` option in `aireplay-ng` is used for the KoreK chop chop attack.

Similar to fragmentation attacks, we want to capture a packet originating from a connected station and destined for the AP. Once a valid packet is found, we approve the selection and start the attack, retrieving the PRGA keystream bit by bit.

```
aireplay-ng -4 -b C8:D1:4D:EA:21:A6 -h 7E:8D:FC:DD:D7:2C wlan0mon
```

Once the attack is completed, we will have two files to work with to forge our ARP request.

```
ls

replay_dec-0805-221220.cap
replay_dec-0805-221220.xor
```

Now, analyze the decrypted packet to identify the source and destination IP addresses.

```
tcpdump -s 0 -n -e -r replay_dec-0805-221220.cap       
```

After identifying the required IP addresses, we can forge an ARP request using `packetforge-ng`. In this command, we specify the access point's MAC address with `-a`, the station’s MAC address with `-h`, the access point’s IP address with `-k`, the station’s IP address with `-l`, the location and name of our PRGA file with `-y`, and finally, the output name for the forged ARP request capture file with `-w`.

```
packetforge-ng -0 -a C8:D1:4D:EA:21:A6 -h 7E:8D:FC:DD:D7:2C -k 192.168.1.1 -l 192.168.1.75 -y replay_dec-0805-221220.xor -w forgedarp.cap
```

Once the forged packet is saved as `forgedarp.cap`, we can inject it into the target network to generate initialization vectors (IVs). One common way to do this is by using [Interactive Packet Replay](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=interactive_packet_replay).

We do so by specifying the interactive packet replay mode with `-2`, the name and location of our forged packet with `-r`, the source MAC address to inject with `-h`, and our interface in monitor mode with `wlan0mon` as shown below.

```
aireplay-ng -2 -r forgedarp.cap -h 7E:8D:FC:DD:D7:2C wlan0mon
```

As this process runs, back in the `airodump-ng` output we can notice that the **Frames** count for the connected station increases. This is a positive sign that many new IVs are being generated.

We can wait until enough packets have been generated before attempting to crack the WEP key. Additionally, to further accelerate the IV generation process, we can use an ARP request replay attack in a new terminal. This approach will expedite the overall process.

```
aireplay-ng -3 -b C8:D1:4D:EA:21:A6 -h 7E:8D:FC:DD:D7:2C wlan0mon
```

Once we have generated enough packets, we can use `aircrack-ng` to crack the WEP key using the captured Initialization Vectors (IVs) stored in the `WEP-01.cap` file.

```
aircrack-ng -b C8:D1:4D:EA:21:A6 WEP-01.cap 
```
