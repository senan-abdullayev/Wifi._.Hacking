Suppose our target network does not have any wireless clients connected and there are no ARP requests coming from any Ethernet-connected stations. In this scenario, we can perform a special `Fragmentation` or `KoreK chop chop` attack in combination with [fake authentication](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=fake_authentication). It's important to note that while this method works on some networks, it is not universally effective, and ultimately depends on whether the network is vulnerable to fake authentication or not.

We will need three terminals for this attack. In the first terminal, we scan the target network and capture its communications using `airodump-ng`.


```
sudo airodump-ng -c 3 --bssid 60:38:E0:71:E9:DC wlan0mon -w WEP
```

Once this is running, in our second terminal we will begin packet crafting attempts. This involves using our interface's MAC address to authenticate with the access point. We employ the following command, specifying fake authentication with `-1`, the re-association interval with `1000`, the ESSID of the network with `-e`, the BSSID with `-a`, our MAC address with `-h`, and the keep-alive request interval with `-q`. Additionally, we use `-o 1` to send only one set of packets at a time.


```
aireplay-ng -1 1000 -o 1 -q 5 -e HTB-Wireless -a 60:38:E0:71:E9:DC -h 00:c0:ca:98:3e:e0 wlan0mon
```

In the `airodump-ng` output, we can confirm that fake authentication was successful as our MAC address now appears as a client connected to the AP.


```
sudo airodump-ng -c 3 --bssid 60:38:E0:71:E9:DC wlan0mon -w WEP
```

Then, in a third terminal, we initiate either a fragmentation or KoreK chop chop attack. To start a KoreK chop chop attack, we use the following command, specifying the access point's BSSID with `-b` and our interface's MAC address with `-h`.

```
aireplay-ng -4 -b 60:38:E0:71:E9:DC -h 00:c0:ca:98:3e:e0 wlan0mon
```

Once we have successfully captured the PRGA keystream to a `.xor` file, we will use `packetforge-ng` to forge a packet and inject it into the network with no stations. We do so with the following command, specifying the access point MAC with `-a`, our associated interface MAC with `-h`, our guessed source IP with `-l`, our guessed destination IP with `-k`, our replay file with `-y`, and write destination with `-w`. If we do not know the IP, we could just use `255.255.255.0` or `255.255.255.255`.

```
packetforge-ng -0 -a 60:38:e0:71:e9:dc -h 00:c0:ca:98:3e:e0 -k 192.168.1.1 -l 192.168.1.64 -y replay_dec-1229-160018.xor -w forgedarp.cap
```

Now that we have a forged ARP packet, we can inject it back into the network. We do so with the following command:

```
aireplay-ng -2 -r forgedarp.cap wlan0mon
```

Once this is going, we wait several moments as the initialization vectors generate. We could also start an ARP request replay attack to speed things up, as we have done previously. Once enough traffic is generated, we can attempt to crack the key with `aircrack-ng`, using the default PTW method:

```
sudo aircrack-ng -b 60:38:E0:71:E9:DC WEP-01.cap
```

It is worth noting that fake authentication is mostly only effective with older routers, as newer routers do not generate broadcast requests when connected via fake authentication.

Attacks on the access point can be done in many different ways, with the typical aim of retrieving the PRGA keystream and key. In the next section, we will explore advanced WEP cracking techniques.
